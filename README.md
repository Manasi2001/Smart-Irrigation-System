#### This Smart Irrigation System makes use of Machine Learning Random Forest Algorithm to intelligently deduce whether the water pump in your garden needs to be on or not on the basis of the moisture content level of your soil and surrounding temperature. So cool!! 

#### According to the [analysis](https://github.com/Manasi2001/Smart-Irrigation-System/blob/main/smart_irrigation.ipynb) performed on the data, the model is 100% accurate. ðŸ˜Ž

## It's â™» THE PERFECT SUSTAINABLE HACK â™» for the gardening lover in you. 

#### Watering your garden every day without letting the soil dry is known as over-irrigation. It is harmful not only for the plants but also for the soil that supports them. Water is the carrier of nutrients. Too much water can wash the essential nutrients away from the plant. And imagine the amount of water being wasted in this process, oh the horror. ðŸ˜± Hence, a system like this is the need of the hour.
 
## âš™ Technicalities of the Project
- The model built using Random Forest is also available for use [here](https://github.com/Manasi2001/Smart-Irrigation-System/blob/main/smartirrigation.pkl).
- A web app has been built using flask (in python).
- The app is successfully deployed on Render.
- The final deployment could be viewed here -> https://smart-irrigation-system.onrender.com/
